# Change the language of the bot

## Commands

* ****[**/language set**](../commands/config-commands.md#language-set)****
* ****[**/language reset**](../commands/config-commands.md#language-reset)****

## Showcase

/language set always shows the currently supported languages by the bot&#x20;

[Click here to see all of the currently supported languages](../currently-supported-languages.md)

If you don't see your language with the command but on the page currently supported languages in gitbook type the english name of the language or the native name

The two buttons are only shown if the user has manage server permission

The first button only changes all of the messages visible to everyone to the selected language and only in the server you are currently in

The second button changes all messages that are only visible for you to the selected language and it's for everywhere
